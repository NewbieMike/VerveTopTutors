          Our story

          <p>
            Hello, and welcome to Verve. My name is Mellisa, and as the founder
            of this platform, I wanted to share our story with you in my own
            words.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The wise words of Albert Einstein hold deep meaning for me. As a
            South African, born and raised in Pretoria, I have witnessed the
            challenges that our schools face. Joy can often feel out of reach in
            some classrooms, but I believe in the power of transformation. The
            magic of a great teacher lies in their ability to create joy even in
            the toughest circumstances, to inspire and bring hope where it’s
            needed most.

        <p>
          One of the biggest challenges I’ve seen in our education system is the
          language barrier. I experienced this firsthand while working at a
          small rural school. The teachers there only spoke English, but the
          students spoke a variety of home languages. I was 19 years old at the
          time, and the reality of the situation hit me hard.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I watched as teachers passionately explained lessons in English, only
          to rely on a handful of students who understood the language to
          translate for their peers. The classroom was filled with confusion,
          frustration, and difficult days. The teachers cared deeply and gave
          their best, but the joy of learning was missing because true
          understanding wasn’t happening for everyone.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Now, at 26 years old, that experience has stayed with me. It became
          clear to me that many of our students are held back not by lack of
          potential but by a lack of access—access to learning in a language
          they truly understand. And so, Verve was born.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Verve is more than just a tutoring platform; it’s a space where
          students can connect with tutors who can explain concepts in their own
          languages. It’s a place where understanding and joy can flourish. I
          recognize the importance of learning English in today’s world, but I
          also understand that it’s a process that takes time, especially when
          your home language is completely different.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          How can we expect our children to thrive when they don’t have the
          tools they need to succeed? The disparities in resources between
          schools are staggering. Children in well-resourced schools often have
          brighter futures, while those in underprivileged or rural schools face
          an uphill battle, often repeating the same cycle of poverty their
          parents experienced.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My dream for Verve is to help break that cycle. By bridging the
          language gap and offering personalized, accessible learning, we can
          give every child a fair chance to achieve their dreams and goals.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This journey is about more than just education; it’s about changing
          lives. I believe that with determination, compassion, and a little bit
          of magic from dedicated teachers and tutors, we can create a better
          future for South Africa.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>May God bless South Africa and her people.</p>
        <br />
        Warm regards, <br />
        Mellisa
